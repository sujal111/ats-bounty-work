Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, weâ€™ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.

        return f"""For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.

Expected JSON format:

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
